Life insurance is almost a basic need. It's the first step in Personal Financial Planning .It fulfills 
different purposes for different people and can provide valuable benefits if you make your choices carefully. 
Like many think mistakenly, it is not just for financial protection in the event of untimely death of a family 
breadwinner. It can also be a comprehensive wealth accumulation solution that benefits almost all. Whether you
are young or old, rich or poor, employed or a business person - you can get a plan tailor made for you.

Life insurance provides two types of benefits - Financial and Behavioral. Financially, the first and the most 
important one - life insurance protects the family against the â€˜cash flow' risk of the untimely death of the 
bread-winner. This is a real risk most of us underplay. Everything does not go as planned. Life throws up nasty
surprises. The only way to somewhat reduce the pain of death in the family is to make sure that at least 
financially the family is secure.<br><br>
Once this risk is taken care of, you need money for things you wanted to do in your life. Educate children, 
build a nice home, have peaceful retirement, meet the wedding expenses of your children and so on. To meet 
these financial goals - you need both Money and Planning. This is where the behavioral advantage of life insurance
scores over others. Life insurance helps you plan early, save regularly, think long term and protect against 
downside risks.<br><br>
When you save through life insurance your behavior changes subtly. You become more cautious, caring, systematic
and disciplined with your savings. As you pay your premiums regularly, your savings accumulate steadily and 
locked in for a specific purpose in future. Life Insurance also gives tax breaks.<br><br>
