As we grow older, get married, build families and start businesses, we come to realize more and more that life insurance is a fundamental part of having a sound financial plan.

Depending on your type of policy, life insurance is fairly cheap, which means there?s no excuse to why you can?t get coverage now! Plus over the years, you?ll find comfort in knowing money will be available to protect your loved ones in the event of your passing. Here are a few other reasons why having life insurance is so important.<br>

<u> <h2 ALIGN="left">1. To Protect Your Family and Loved Ones</h2></u><br>

If your loved ones depend on your financial support for their livelihood, then life insurance is a must, because it replaces your income when you die. This is especially important for parents of young children or couples who?s partner will find it difficult if they no longer have the source of income provide by their partner.

You will also need to provide enough money to cover the costs of hiring someone to cover the day to day household tasks, like cleaning, laundry, cooking, childcare and everything else a growing family needs.<br>

<u> <h2 ALIGN="left">2. To Leave An Inheritance</h2></u><br>

Even if you don?t have any other assets to pass to your heirs, you can create an inheritance by buying a life insurance policy and naming them as beneficiaries. This is a great way to set your kids up for a solid financial future and provide for any monetary needs that will arise.<br>

In addition to providing income to cover everyday living expenses, your family needs insurance to cover any outstanding debts, like the mortgage, credit cards and car loans.

Other expenses include funeral and burial costs that can easily run into the tens of thousands of dollars. You don?t want your spouse, parents, children or other loved ones to be left with any extra financial burden in addition to the emotional burden they?re already suffering.<br>

Like most parents you probably want to know your kids will be well taken care of when you?re gone. You not only want them to get a quality college education, but to provide for other life ventures like getting married or starting a business. For this reason, additional coverage is absolutely essential while your kids are still at home.<br>

<u> <h2 ALIGN="left">5. To Bring Peace of Mind</h2></u><br>

No amount of money can ever replace a person. But more than anything, life insurance can help provide protection for the uncertainties in life. Without a doubt, having life insurance coverage will bring you and your family peace of mind. It?s one thing you can be sure of and no longer question if they?ll be taken care of when you?re gone.

None of us know when we?ll pass away. It could be today, tomorrow, or 50 years into the future, but it will happen eventually. Life insurance protects your heirs from the unknown and helps them through an otherwise difficult time of loss.
